<p>WeCoOwn (WeCo) provides a universal listing and posting platform for its members who are potential buyers or existing owners of any properties or assets to search and meet potential co-owners to purchase or co-own these properties or assets together. Regular members on the platform enjoy free access to all these services. </p>
<p>The properties and assets that we currently provide our members access to are mostly high priced discretionary items such as Commercial Ships, Super Yachts, Recreational Boats, Luxury Private Jets, Single Piston Aircraft, Helicopters, Luxury Cars, RVs, Race Horses, Artworks, Office Buildings, Land Parcels, Condos, Single Family Houses and Vacation Homes, etc. but it could be any property or asset that the members would like to share or co-own with other members. Please feel free to make suggestions to us for adding new property or asset categories. </p>
<p>The legal formats to be used for holding the titles of these co-owned properties vary from country to country. It could be a simple Limited Liability Company (LLC) as often used in the US or it could be any other legal corporate structures or partnerships in other countries. There are vendor sponsors in many countries to provide members of the platform with the appropriate structure to facilitate the sales.</p>
<p>While the fractional shares based co-ownership has been utilized in the past on a fragmented basis in various sectors around the world, no web or mobile application services have been able to provide the prospective and existing co-owners with a centralized meeting place or on-line platform to find other co-owners together with dedicated human concierge services provided by vendors on the platform or an intelligent property management and booking reservation software for the management of these co-owned properties or assets. the listings of those to-be co-owned properties. WeCoOwn platform aims to fulfill those needs.</p>
<p>Through the prudent use of sophisticated blockchain and smart contract technologies, WeCoOwn provides software as a service to both large licensed brokers and management companies that professionally manage the fractional share programs for expensive properties and assets such as super yachts and private jets as well as those regular individual lead co-owners (champion co-owners) who have met and recruited other participating co-owners (follower co-owners) through the WeCoOwn platform to own modest properties such as a sailboat, a commuter car, van or a recreational aircraft together.</p>
<p>In addition to helping members create the primary market structures of the original legal entities to own these properties, through our broker sponsors in various countries, WeCoOwn may also provide the secondary market exchange of the fractional shares of these legal entities in order for our members to obtain financial gains or to protect their investments in these properties of high financial value. WeCoOwn remains a listing platform for such secondary market services. </p>
<p>Blockchain and smart contract related technologies will be employed in our continuing software upgrades to provide the state of the art security, accounting and ownership provenance record keeping. While WeCoOwn currently provides services on a few high priced luxury discretionary properties located in the US during the initial launch stage, it is the goal of the management to expand the listing, meeting and posting platform and related software application services into many other property asset classes with many geographical locations around the world as the company’s activities grow.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions on how we could make these services work better for you. Thank you.</p>
