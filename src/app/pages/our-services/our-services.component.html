            country. It could be a simple Limited Liability Company (LLC) as often used in the US or it could be any
            other legal corporate structures or partnerships in other countries. There are vendor sponsors in many
            countries to provide members of the platform with the appropriate structure to facilitate the sales.
        </p>
        <p>While the fractional shares based co-ownership has been utilized in the past on a fragmented basis in various
            sectors around the world, no web or mobile application services have been able to provide the perspective
            and existing co-owners with a centralized meeting place or on-line platform to find other co-owners together
            with dedicated human concierge services provided by vendors on the platform or intelligent property

            listings of those to-be co-owned properties. WeCoOwn platform aims to fulfill those needs.</p>
        <p>Through the prudent use of sophisticated blockchain and smart contract technologies, WeCoOwn provides
            software as a service to both large licensed brokers and management companies that professionally manage the
            fractional share programs for expensive properties and assets such as superyachts and private jets as well
            as those regular individual lead co-owners (champion co-owners) who have met and recruited other
            participating co-owners (follower co-owners) through the WeCoOwn platform to own modest properties such as a
            sailboat, a commuter car, van or a recreational aircraft together.</p>
        <p>In addition to helping members create the primary market structures of the original legal entities to own
            these properties, through our broker sponsors in various countries, WeCoOwn may also provide the secondary
            market exchange of the fractional shares of these legal entities in order for our members to obtain
            financial gains or to protect their investments in these properties of high financial value. WeCoOwn remains
            a listing platform for such secondary market services. </p>

            currently provides services on a few high priced luxury discretionary properties located in the US during
            the initial launch stage, it is the goal of the management to expand the listing, meeting, and posting
            platform and related software application services into many other property asset classes with many
            geographical locations around the world as the companyâ€™s activities grow.
