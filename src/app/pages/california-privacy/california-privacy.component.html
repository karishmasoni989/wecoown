        <p><strong>Categories of Sources</strong> <br>We obtain the categories of personal information listed
            above:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>from the companies from which we buy or consider buying loans (our “customers”) or their agents, from
                our loan servicing agents and from our service providers in connection with the purchase and
                securitization of loans and the resecuritization and sale of such securities.</li>
            <li>from our Seller/Servicers and other entities that sell or seek to sell us mortgages or to have us
                securitize their mortgages.</li>
            <li>from credit bureaus and other vendors who provide credit and other background information on individuals
                for credit and due diligence purposes.</li>
            <li>from activity on our websites (for example, from submissions through our website portals or from
                automatically collected website usage details).</li>
            <li>from third-parties from whom we obtain products or services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong> <br>We may use or disclose personal information we
            collect for one or more of the following business purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To fulfill the request or satisfy the reason for which the information is provided. For example, if a
                mortgage broker provides us with personal information in order for us to consider buying a loan, we use
                that information to assess the loan and, if we buy it, to service it and securitize it.</li>
            <li>In connection with activities related to buying mortgages, securitizing them and selling the securities
                (our secondary market-related activities). &nbsp;For example, we use personal information to evaluate
                loans that we are considering buying or guaranteeing and to monitor the performance of loans that we own
                or guarantee. As another example, we use this information to evaluate the value of properties
                collateralizing these loans and to predict default.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>To establish and manage our relationships with brokers, third party loan originators, and other entities
                with whom we conduct business, such as information about these entities’ employees, agents, principals,
                officers and guarantors.&nbsp; This may include names, photographs/images, email addresses, phone
                numbers and other contact information for the employees of these entities with whom we are dealing.</li>
            <li>If you send us an email or message and provide your name or other personal information, we may use this
                information to research your question, to send an answer to your question and to deliver the requested
                information or service to you. We also may use this information to provide you with information in which
                we believe you will be interested; however, at any time, you may request that we stop doing this by
                contacting us in the manner described in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Notice.</li>
            <li>To provide our customers with email alerts, event registrations and other notices concerning our
                products or services, events, news, or other items that may be of interest.</li>
            <li>With regard to website visitor information, to measure the number of visitors to different pages on the
                website, conduct statistical modeling and evaluate, modify and enhance our websites, our services and
                our business. We also use this information to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized
                access or unusual activity on the website.</li>
            <li>For purposes of testing, research, analysis, modeling and product development related to our public
                mission, business and websites. We may publish the results of our research, but we will not publish
                personally identifiable information about you as part of the publication.</li>
            <li>In connection with employment applications to, or employment with, Freddie Mac, and in connection with
                our employment processes more generally (such as assessing an individual’s suitability for a position,
                determining compensation and eligibility to work, arranging or reimbursing travel and other expenses,
                career planning and development, compliance with policies and procedures, administering benefits,
                maintaining emergency contacts and granting access to internal systems).</li>
            <li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any loan documents or other contracts
                we have entered into, including for collections.</li>
            <li>To evaluate or conduct a restructuring, reorganization, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our
                assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in
                which personal information held by us is among the assets transferred.</li>

                facilities, if you work for or with Freddie Mac (sometimes including Biometric Identifiers).</li>
            <li>As necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers or others.

            <li>For security or the prevention, detection, or investigation of fraud, suspected or actual illegal
                activity, or other misconduct.</li>
            <li>To establish or defend legal claims and allegations.</li>
            <li>To seek advice from lawyers, auditors and other professional advisers.</li>
            <li>As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not do the following things with your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not sell personal information to third parties for advertising or marketing products and services
                to you, or to third parties whose purpose in acquiring the information is to sell your personal
                information to others for advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
            <li>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we
                collect for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without first providing you notice
                in the manner specified in the "Changes to this Notice" section of this Notice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How We Share Personal Information</strong> <br>We may disclose your personal information to
            third parties for business-related purposes.&nbsp; Before we disclose personal information for a business
            purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient not to use or disclose
            the information except for purposes specified in the contract (typically to perform services for us).<br>In
            the preceding twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for a
            business purpose:</p>

        <p>As noted earlier in this Notice, we respond only to requests that are verifiable consumer requests.&nbsp;
            Therefore, when you submit a request to us, we will seek to verify your identity by asking you to provide us
            with information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address or the last four digits of your
            social security number.&nbsp; We also may use a third-party verification provider to verify your
            identity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
            or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.&nbsp; Making a request
            does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp; We will only use personal information provided in a
            request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        <p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></p>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to each verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.&nbsp; If we require
            more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.&nbsp; If you already have an
            account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.&nbsp; If you do not have an account
            with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.&nbsp; Any
            disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer
            request.&nbsp; For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
            that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity
            without hindrance.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
            repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp; If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you
            why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong> <br>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of
            your CCPA rights. Except to the extent permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
            <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or
                other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
            <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
            <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or
                quality of goods or services.</li>
        </ul>
