                                <h3>There are four types of WeCoOwn memberships : </h3>
    <p>1. Basic Membership (Free Membership) â€“ Any one who may want to showcase what assets they currently have and may in the near future become a listing member either to sell, to rent, to find co-owners, to participate as a co-owner or to buy the property outright. For example, the member could use co-ownership listing function to become a potential buyer looking for other co-owners to join in the purchase of a property together or the member could be an existing property owner who is looking to sell a part of his/her ownership in a property. The membership&nbsp;is absolutely free.</p>
    <p>Basic Membership is available to everybody. The members will be free to list properties to sell, to buy properties, to charter or rent a property, to list to find other co-owners and to join others to co-own a property. The cost is free.</p>
    <p>2. Basic Plus Membership is intended for a higher level use of the platform and the web applications by the owners and co-owners to manage their properties.</p>
    <p>The number of listings are limited to 10 listings. The cost is $29 per month on a pre-paid month to month basis. The subscription could be cancelled before the end of the any month but there is no refund for the remaining prorated period of that month.</p>
    <p>3. Premium Membership is intended for a higher level use of the platform and the web applications by the owners and co-owners to manage their properties. In addition to the privileges that Basic Plus Members have, they will have access to the expanded use of the co-ownership property management web applications to manage the properties that they own on an on-going monthly basis.</p>
    <p>The number of listings are limited to 50 listings. The cost is $99 per month on a pre-paid month to month basis. The subscription could be cancelled before the end of the any month but there is no refund for the remaining prorated period of that month.</p>
