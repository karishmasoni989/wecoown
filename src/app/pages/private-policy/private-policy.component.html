            connect
            your WeCoOwn Account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and
            remove permission for the app by changing your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your
            personal
            information up-to-date.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.
        </h4>
        <p>
            You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information about you (and which
            you
            cannot update yourself within your WeCoOwn Account).

            Data Access and Portability.
        </h4>
        <p>
            In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain copies of your personal information
            held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us
            in a
            structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to

            contract
            between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. In certain jurisdictions, you can request to

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests,
                such as
                fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an WeCoOwn Account for
                fraud or
                safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that WeCoOwn Account to prevent that Member from
                opening
                a new WeCoOwn Account in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations.

                auditing obligations.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly
                visible on
                the WeCoOwn Platform, even after your WeCoOwn Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such
                information to
                you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our
                database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> Because we maintain the WeCoOwn Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction,
                residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited
                period of
                time.

            Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.
        </h4>
        <p>

            time
            by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to WeCoOwn specifying which consent you are
            withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any
            processing
            activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law
            may
            give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you
            contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the
            erasure of
            your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the
            processing,
            but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have
            objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate
            grounds
            of WeCoOwn override your own.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Objection to Processing.
        </h4>
        <p>
            In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require WeCoOwn and WeCoOwn Payments not to process
            your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based
            on
            legitimate interest. If you object to such processing WeCoOwn and/or WeCoOwn Payments will no longer process
            your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
            such
            processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
            Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask WeCoOwn
            to
            cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to info@WeCoOwn.com.

            HOW WE SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION
        </h3>
        <p>
            We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of
            personally identifiable information that we receive, including computer files and documents that contain the
            information. Our standards are designed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> Protect the security and confidentiality of the information;
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information; and
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>● </strong> Protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information that could result in substantial harm
                or
                inconvenience to an individual, such as a borrower, consumer, or employee.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We restrict access to personally identifiable information to those who need to know the information for our
            business purposes. We follow a corporate records retention program that requires us to destroy information
            we no
            longer need for our business or reasonable archival purposes. We destroy, erase, or make unreadable such
            information prior to disposal as required by applicable law. Our policies and our agreements with third
            parties
            require appropriate security and confidentiality standards to protect the confidentiality of personally
            identifiable information (including Website Visitor Information) and prohibit its unlawful disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strive to maintain a high standard of security and privacy. However, no information can be guaranteed to
            be
            completely secure, and we make no such warranty or guarantee.
